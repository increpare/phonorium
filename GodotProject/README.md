# Instructions:
* Movement: WASD
* Jump: SPACE
* Walk: ALT
* Sprint: CTRL
* Interact: E
* Pick up/leave: F
* Throw: LMB (hold)
* Reset: R

# It needs some more polish:
There are a couple of things that could be fixed. Mainly rigid objects clipping through walls and through the drawers (when you put a ball into a drawer and close it, the ball clipps through). Not sure how it can be fixed though.
